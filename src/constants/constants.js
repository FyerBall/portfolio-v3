export const aboutMe = `Hi, my name is Meshari and I have always been passionate about technology and Computer Science. When I was growing up, I spent the majority of my time studying and learning network and security. It started with building my own PC to support my working and testing environments during that time, I got familiar with a few programming languages such as C++, Python, and Java. However, in late 2015, I started my Front-End development journey, and it has become my new passion. Now, I only use JavaScript, mainly ReactJS, along with HTML and CSS. I would welcome the opportunity to work with you.`
