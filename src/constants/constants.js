export const aboutMe = `Hi, my name is Meshari and I have always been passionate about technology and computer since. When I was growing up, I spent the majority of my time studying and learning network and security. It started with building my own PC to support my working and testing environments. My goal was to be a cyber security expert. I got familiar with a few programming languages such as C++, Python and Java. However, late 2015, I started my Front End development journey and it has become my new passion. Now, I use Javascript, mainly ReactJS, and I am currently working on back end development. I would welcome the opportunity to work with you.`
